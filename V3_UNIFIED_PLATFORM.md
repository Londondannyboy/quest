# V3 Unified Platform Strategy

*Last Updated: December 2024*

## Vision

**One Platform, Multiple Perspectives**

Quest V3 serves the entire startup ecosystem through a single, unified platform that adapts based on who you are:
- **Founders** see funding opportunities and talent
- **Investors** see qualified deal flow
- **Professionals** see purpose-driven jobs
- **Journalists** see authentic stories

## Why Unified?

### The Problem with Separate Apps
1. **Development overhead**: 3x the code to maintain
2. **User confusion**: Which app do I use?
3. **Data silos**: No network effects
4. **Higher costs**: Multiple deployments, databases
5. **Slower iteration**: Changes needed in multiple places

### The Power of Unity
1. **Network effects**: Each user strengthens the whole platform
2. **Single sign-on**: One account for everything
3. **Cross-pollination**: Founders become investors, professionals become founders
4. **Shared infrastructure**: 70% code reuse
5. **Rapid development**: Ship once, benefit all

## Architecture

### Single Next.js Application

```typescript
// app/layout.tsx - Unified layout with role detection
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  const { user } = useAuth()
  const userRole = user?.metadata?.primaryRole || 'visitor'
  
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <Navigation role={userRole} />
        <main className={`quest-${userRole}`}>
          {children}
        </main>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

### Dynamic Home Experience

```typescript
// app/page.tsx - Adaptive homepage
export default function HomePage() {
  const { user } = useAuth()
  
  if (!user) return <LandingPage />
  
  switch (user.metadata.primaryRole) {
    case 'founder':
      return <FounderDashboard />
    case 'investor':
      return <InvestorDashboard />
    case 'professional':
      return <ProfessionalDashboard />
    case 'journalist':
      return <JournalistDashboard />
    default:
      return <RoleSelectionFlow />
  }
}
```

### Unified Data Model

```typescript
// Everyone has Trinity
interface UnifiedUser {
  id: string
  email: string
  name: string
  
  // Core identity
  trinity: {
    quest: string    // What drives you
    service: string  // How you serve
    pledge: string   // What you commit to
  }
  
  // Role-specific data
  primaryRole: 'founder' | 'investor' | 'professional' | 'journalist'
  secondaryRoles: string[]
  
  // Unified activity
  connections: Connection[]
  introductions: Introduction[]
  messages: Message[]
}
```

### Component Architecture

```typescript
// Shared components adapt based on context
export function DiscoveryCard({ item, userRole }) {
  // Same component, different rendering
  switch (item.type) {
    case 'investor':
      return <InvestorCard investor={item} showActions={userRole === 'founder'} />
    case 'job':
      return <JobCard job={item} showApply={userRole === 'professional'} />
    case 'story':
      return <StoryCard story={item} showPitch={userRole === 'founder'} />
  }
}
```

### Unified Search

```typescript
// One search, multiple perspectives
export function UnifiedSearch() {
  const { user } = useAuth()
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('')
  
  const results = useSearch(query, {
    types: getSearchTypesForRole(user.metadata.primaryRole),
    filters: getTrinityFilters(user.trinity)
  })
  
  return (
    <SearchInterface>
      <SearchBar value={query} onChange={setQuery} />
      <SearchResults results={results} userContext={user} />
    </SearchInterface>
  )
}
```
