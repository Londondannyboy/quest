## üìà **Detailed Scoring Rationale**

### **Idea/Concept Evolution**
- **Legacy (7/10)**: Good vision but unfocused - "AI for careers"
- **Current (8.5/10)**: Trinity system is revolutionary but incomplete
- **V2 (9.5/10)**: Philosophy + technology fusion is uncopiable

### **Product/Market Fit**
- **Legacy (6/10)**: Another job search platform with AI
- **Current (7.5/10)**: Unique positioning but limited features
- **V2 (9/10)**: "Earn your Quest" creates new category

### **Security/Code Security**
- **Legacy (5/10)**: Documented security incident, basic practices
- **Current (6.5/10)**: Better but auth flow issues remain
- **V2 (8/10)**: Semgrep MCP planned, but incident learnings missing

### **Code Efficiency**

## üéØ **Recommendations for V2 Completeness**

### **1. Document Missing Services**
```markdown
### Web Search Integration
- **Tavily API**: AI-powered search for professional content
  - Use Case: Discover talks, articles, thought leadership
  - Cost: $XXX per 1000 searches
  - Integration: Phase 2 enhancement
  
- **LinkUp API**: Job market intelligence

  - Cost: $XXX per month
  - Integration: Skills Coach enhancement
```

### **2. Clarify Neo4j Positioning**
- Move from "Future" to "Core Database" category
- Document graph queries for relationship intelligence
- Specify when to use PostgreSQL vs Neo4j

### **3. Security Hardening Documentation**
- Create `V2_SECURITY_LEARNINGS.md` with:
  - API key management best practices
  - Incident response procedures
  - Audit trail requirements
  - Data encryption standards

### **4. Performance Benchmarks**
- Page load: <2 seconds
- Voice response: <500ms
- Graph rendering: 60fps with 1000 nodes
- Cost per user: <$0.50/month

### **5. Multi-Platform Scraping Strategy**
```typescript
// Document the full enrichment pipeline
const enrichmentPipeline = {

  secondary: [
    'GitHub profile and contributions',
    'Twitter/X thought leadership',
    'Personal website/blog',
    'YouTube/podcast appearances'
  ],
  orchestration: 'n8n workflows',
