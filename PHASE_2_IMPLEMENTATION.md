# Phase 2 Implementation: Trinity & Quest Journey

**Start Date**: January 28, 2025  
**Target Completion**: February 18, 2025  
**Philosophy**: Coach-guided Trinity discovery through authentic story exploration

---

## üéØ Implementation Strategy

### Core Decision: Coach-Guided Trinity Discovery

Users will NOT be prompted for Trinity immediately. Instead:

1. Professional Mirror presents their "instant twin"
2. Story Coach explores their journey
3. Quest Coach reveals patterns and guides Trinity discovery
4. Delivery Coach gates Quest readiness (30% pass rate)
