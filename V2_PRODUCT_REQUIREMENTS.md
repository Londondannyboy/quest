## üéØ **Executive Summary**

Quest Core V2 transforms professional development from a transactional platform to a transformational journey where users must **earn their Quest through story**. 

**Key Differentiators:**
- Users don't "sign up" - they begin their "story"
- 30% must earn Quest readiness (aspirational scarcity)
- Trinity evolves through time (Past ‚Üí Present ‚Üí Future)
- Entity-based data (no strings, only validated objects)
- Multi-voice coaching with signature transitions

**Scoring Evolution**: Legacy (6.5/10) ‚Üí Current (7.6/10) ‚Üí V2 (9.6/10)

## üèîÔ∏è **Core Product Vision**

### **The Sacred Journey**
```
Story Collection ‚Üí Trinity Recognition ‚Üí Quest Readiness ‚Üí Quest Activation
     (Act 1)           (Act 2)              (Gate)           (Begin)
```

### **Philosophy**
- **Quest**: "What drives you?" (Purpose)
- **Service**: "How do you serve?" (Value)
- **Pledge**: "What do you commit to?" (Promise)

### **Core Beliefs**
- "LinkedIn shows who you were. Quest shows who you're becoming."
- Sacred threshold: Making "not yet" an invitation, not rejection
- Story as foundation: Everything builds from authentic narrative
- Continuous Trinity evolution: Not static purpose discovery
- Professional awakening: Transformation over transaction

### **Manifesto Principles**
1. Every feature must serve the Story ‚Üí Trinity ‚Üí Quest journey
2. Human dignity over conversion optimization
3. Earned access creates aspiration
4. Coaches guide, users discover
5. Data serves story, not surveillance

---

## üé≠ **User Journey Architecture**

### **Act 1: Professional Mirror (3-5 minutes)**

#### **Entry Point**
- LinkedIn URL or name search
- Consent: "May we discover your professional story?"

#### **Mirror Presentation**
```typescript
interface ProfessionalMirror {
  visualization: "Timeline with floating nodes",
  messaging: "This is how the world sees you",
  corrections: "Click any node to correct our understanding",
  transparency: "Here's what we found (and might have missed)"
}
```

#### **Enhanced Discovery (Shock & Awe Strategy)**
- **Phase 1**: LinkedIn via Apify + Harvest API for company intelligence
- **Phase 2**: Tavily web search (articles, talks, GitHub)
- **Phase 3**: LinkUp market intelligence + salary benchmarking
- **Real-time Progress**: Progressive UI reveals during data gathering
- **3D Organizational Charts**: Company relationships and influence mapping

#### **Voice**: Story Coach (Female, Warm)
- "Tell me about this transition..."
- "What drew you to [field]?"
- "I notice a pattern here..."

### **Act 2: Trinity Evolution (5-7 minutes)**

#### **Trinity Through Time**
```typescript
interface TrinityEvolution {
  past: {
    quest: "What drove you then?",
    visual: "Faded constellation forming"
  },
  present: {
    quest: "What drives you now?",
    visual: "Bright, active constellation"
  },
  future: {
    quest: "What will drive you?",
    visual: "Emerging, pulsing constellation"
  }
}
```

#### **Pattern Recognition**
- AI identifies themes across timeline
- Coaches highlight evolution
- User validates or corrects

#### **Voice Transition**: Quest Coach (Male, CA/UK)
- *Signature sound effect*
- "Welcome to your Quest. I see your Trinity emerging..."
- More energetic, forward-looking

### **Act 3: Quest Readiness Gate**

#### **Assessment Algorithm**
```typescript
const readinessScore = 
  (storyDepth * 0.3) +        // How much they shared
  (trinityClarity * 0.4) +    // How clear their purpose
  (futureOrientation * 0.3);  // How ready for growth

if (readinessScore >= 70) return "QUEST_READY";
if (readinessScore >= 40) return "PREPARING";
return "NOT_YET";
```

#### **Three Outcomes**
1. **Quest Ready (70%)**: Proceed to Quest activation
2. **Preparing (25%)**: Guided exercises to clarify
3. **Not Yet (5%)**: Supportive redirection

#### **Voice**: OKR/Delivery Coach (Firm, Achievement-focused)
- "I'm taking over now. Let's make this real..."
- "Your Quest requires commitment. Are you ready?"

## üóÑÔ∏è **Data & Entity Management**

### **Entity-First Architecture**

#### **Core Principle**
Every piece of data is an entity with relationships - NO STRINGS.

#### **Entity Types**
```typescript
interface EntitySystem {
  companies: {
    verified: boolean,
    lastScraped: Date,
    parentCompany?: Company,
    subsidiaries: Company[],
    validatedBy: User[]
  },
  skills: {
    name: string,
    cluster: SkillCluster,
    parentSkill?: Skill,
    relatedSkills: Skill[],
    marketDemand: number
  },
  education: {
    institution: Entity,
    verified: boolean,
    ranking?: number,
    specialties: string[]
  }
}
```

### **Synthetic Organizations**

#### **Concept**
When scraping reveals companies/people, create "synthetic" provisional entities that users validate.

```typescript
interface SyntheticEntity {
  type: "company" | "person" | "skill",
  confidence: number,  // AI confidence in accuracy
  status: "provisional" | "validated" | "rejected",
  validators: User[],  // Users who confirmed
  created: Date,
  source: "linkedin" | "tavily" | "user"
}
```

#### **Validation Flow**
1. Scrape creates provisional entities
2. Display with transparency: "We think this is..."
3. User validates/corrects
4. Validated entities become "real"
5. Build trust network of confirmations

### **Skill Clustering & Intelligence**

#### **AI-Powered Taxonomy**
```typescript
interface SkillCluster {
  name: "Digital Marketing",
  coreSkills: ["SEO", "SEM", "Content Marketing"],
  emergingSkills: ["AI Marketing", "Voice Search"],
  parentCluster: "Marketing",
  demandTrend: "increasing",
  salaryPremium: 15  // % above base
}
```

#### **Dynamic Grouping**
- AI groups related skills automatically
- Market data informs clustering
- User corrections improve taxonomy
- Visualizations show skill relationships

### **Caching & Deduplication**

#### **Smart Rescraping**
```typescript
const shouldRescrape = (entity: Entity): boolean => {
  const sixMonthsAgo = new Date();
  sixMonthsAgo.setMonth(sixMonthsAgo.getMonth() - 6);
  
  return entity.lastScraped < sixMonthsAgo || 
         entity.majorEventFlag || 
         entity.userRequested;
};
```

#### **Deduplication Strategy**
1. Fuzzy matching on names
2. Domain matching for companies
3. LinkedIn URL as unique identifier
4. User validation for conflicts

interface VoiceTransition {
  trigger: "Trinity clarity reached" | "Quest readiness achieved",
  effect: "Signature sound + brief silence",
  announcement: "New coach introduces themselves",
  continuity: "References previous coach's insights"
}
```

### **AI Model Strategy** (via OpenRouter)

#### **Cost-Optimized Routing**
```typescript
const modelSelection = {
  storyCoach: "anthropic/claude-3-sonnet",     // Empathetic ($3/M)
  questCoach: "openai/gpt-4-turbo",           // Insightful ($10/M)
  deliveryCoach: "moonshotai/kimi-k2",        // Direct ($0.15/M)
  skillsAnalysis: "moonshotai/kimi-k2:free",  // Zero cost
  patternRecognition: "google/gemini-pro",     // Large context ($0.5/M)
  fallback: "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo"            // Budget option ($0.5/M)
};

// Automatic fallback on errors
const routeWithFallback = async (primary: string, fallback: string) => {
  try {
    return await openRouter.chat(primary);
  } catch (error) {
    return await openRouter.chat(fallback);
  }
};
```
