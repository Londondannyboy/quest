# Voice Coach Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

### 1. ❌ CLM URL Was Pointing to Old Quest Core

**Root Cause**: The Hume dashboard had the wrong CLM endpoint configured
**Impact**:

- User context not working (coach doesn't know user's name)
- Possible cause of duplicate voices

### 2. ❌ Duplicate Voice Issue

**Symptoms**: Two voices speaking at different times, interrupting each other
**Potential Causes**:

- Multiple WebSocket connections
- Audio chunks being processed twice
- React StrictMode in development

### 3. ❌ No User Context

**Symptoms**: Voice coach thinks user is "David Hume"
**Cause**: CLM endpoint not receiving user information

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Added User Context to WebSocket URL

```typescript
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  access_token: accessToken,
  config_id: configId || '',
  user_id: user?.id || 'anonymous',
  user_name: user?.fullName || user?.firstName || 'User',
  session_id: audioSessionIdRef.current,
})
```

### 2. ✅ Enhanced CLM Endpoint

- Added user context extraction from message metadata
- Improved logging with unique call IDs
- Better user identification fallback

### 3. ✅ Implemented Audio Fingerprinting

- Global audio fingerprint manager
- Detects and prevents duplicate audio chunks
- Tracks audio sources

### 4. ✅ Added Connection Guards

- Check if already connecting before new connection
- Clear audio queue on new connection
- Track processed audio IDs

### 5. ✅ Created Debug Tools

- `/trinity-debug` page for real-time monitoring
- `/api/hume/verify-config` endpoint
- `/api/debug/zen-analyze` for multi-LLM debugging

### 6. ✅ Integrated Monitoring

- Zep memory tracking for all events
- Enhanced logging throughout
- Session-based audio tracking

## Deployment Checklist

### 1. Update Hume Dashboard

**CRITICAL**: Update the CLM URL in Hume configuration to:

```
https://quest-omega-wheat.vercel.app/api/hume-clm-sse/chat/completions
```

Config ID: `671d99bc-1358-4aa7-b92a-d6b762cb18b5`

### 2. Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in Vercel:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUME_API_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUME_SECRET_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUME_CONFIG_ID`

### 3. Test After Deployment

#### Test 1: User Context

1. Sign in as a user
2. Go to `/trinity`
3. Start a session
4. Verify the coach uses your actual name

#### Test 2: No Duplicate Voices

1. Open browser console
2. Start a session
3. Look for `[AUDIO]` logs
4. Verify no duplicate warnings
5. Listen for single voice only

#### Test 3: Debug Tools

1. Visit `/trinity-debug`
2. Get token and connect
3. Monitor:
   - Connection count (should be 1)
   - Audio chunks
   - No duplicate sources

#### Test 4: Verify Config

1. Visit `/api/hume/verify-config` (when signed in)
2. Check:
   - `hasCustomLLM: true`
   - `customLLMUrl` points to V2
   - `clmStatus: reachable`

## Monitoring in Production

### Console Logs to Watch

```
[AUDIO] Received chunk - Size: X, Session: Y
[AUDIO] Playing chunk...
[AUDIO] Skipping duplicate chunk (if any)
[CLM XXX] ========== NEW CLM REQUEST ==========
User context sent: {userId: "...", userName: "..."}
```

### Zep Events to Monitor

- `connection_event`
- `audio_played`
- `audio_duplicate` (should be minimal)
- `user_message`
- `assistant_message`

## If Issues Persist

### 1. Duplicate Voices Still Present

- Check browser console for multiple WebSocket connections
- Look for `[AUDIO] Skipping duplicate` messages
- Use `/trinity-debug` to monitor connections

### 2. User Context Still Missing

- Verify CLM URL is updated in Hume
- Check CLM logs for user identification
- Test `/api/hume/verify-config` endpoint

### 3. Connection Issues

- Clear browser cache
- Check for multiple tabs open
- Verify environment variables

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to production
2. Update Hume CLM URL
3. Test thoroughly
4. Monitor logs
5. Use Zen MCP debugging if needed

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Coach addresses user by correct name
- [ ] Only one voice at a time
- [ ] Smooth conversation flow
- [ ] Can interrupt by speaking
- [ ] Debug tools show clean data
