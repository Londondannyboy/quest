# Apify Integration Fix Summary

## Problem
The Apify integration in Quest Core was not working because the API credentials were not configured.

## Solution Applied
Based on the successful implementation in the `apify-mp-mcp-server` project, we applied the following fix:

### 1. Updated Environment Variables
Updated `.env.local` with working Apify credentials:
```env
APIFY_API_KEY=your_apify_api_key_here
APIFY_TOKEN=your_apify_api_key_here  # Same as APIFY_API_KEY for MCP compatibility
APIFY_USER_ID=your_apify_user_id_here
```

**Note**: The actual API credentials have been added to the local environment file and need to be added to Vercel for production deployment.

### 2. Verified Actor Configuration
The project is already correctly configured to use:
- Actor ID: `harvestapi/linkedin-profile-scraper`
- Task ID: `LpVuK3Zozwuipa5bp`

### 3. Key Learnings from Simple Implementation
From the successful `apify-mp-mcp-server` project, we learned:
- Direct API integration is simpler and more reliable than MCP for web applications
- The `harvestapi/linkedin-profile-scraper` actor works reliably with proper credentials
- Simple POST endpoint pattern works well for scraping triggers

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test via Admin Interface
Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/admin/test-scraping
- Enter a LinkedIn URL (e.g., https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamhgates/)
- Click "Test LinkedIn Scraping"

### 3. Test via API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-profile-simple \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"linkedinUrl": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamhgates/"}'
```

## Expected Result
The scraping should now work and return profile data including:
- Name
- Headline
- Location
- Skills count
- Experience count
- Education count

## Architecture Notes
Quest Core's implementation is more sophisticated than the simple example:
- Supports both MCP and Direct API with automatic fallback
- Includes rate limiting (2 seconds between requests)
- Has comprehensive error handling
- Includes multiple scrapers (profile, company, employees)
- Integrates with the enrichment pipeline

## Next Steps
1. Test the integration thoroughly
2. Consider implementing the simplified patterns from `apify-scraper-implementation.md` for future scrapers
3. Monitor API usage and costs
4. Update production environment variables in Vercel
