> **Optimized restart prompt for `/clear` sessions**  
> **Last Updated**: July 19, 2025 - Post Design System Integration

## üéØ **Essential Project Context**

Quest Core is a revolutionary professional development platform built on a **4-layer repository system** that guides users through discovering their authentic professional identity via the Trinity system: **Quest** (what drives you), **Service** (how you serve), and **Pledge** (what you commit to).

> **Core Innovation**: "LinkedIn shows who you were. Quest shows who you're becoming."

### **Value Proposition**
- **Working Repo**: The missing layer between public LinkedIn profiles and private career planning
- **Selective Portfolio**: Rich multimedia project showcases with granular access control
- **AI-Powered Coaching**: Voice-first coaching with persistent memory and Trinity evolution
- **Premium Experience**: Sophisticated visual language with cutting-edge adaptive interfaces

## üèóÔ∏è **Current Architecture (Stable Foundation)**

### **‚úÖ Production-Ready Systems**

**Alternative**: Complete Zep integration (enables all future AI enhancements)

## üìã **Immediate Session Priorities**

### **Option A: Working Repo Implementation (RECOMMENDED)**
**Time**: 3-4 hours | **Value**: Highest | **Dependencies**: None
- [ ] Implement Working Repo database models and API endpoints
- [ ] Create selective access control system with permissions
- [ ] Build project showcase and achievement story components  
- [ ] Add multimedia support and portfolio presentation
- [ ] Test complete Working Repo workflow

### **Option B: Complete Zep Integration**
**Time**: 3-4 hours | **Value**: High | **Dependencies**: Zep account
- [ ] Install Zep SDK and configure environment
- [ ] Implement user creation with Clerk ID consistency
- [ ] Enhance voice coaching with persistent memory
- [ ] Create context retrieval for coaching responses
- [ ] Test memory continuity across sessions

### **‚ùå NOT RECOMMENDED: Multi-System Parallel Implementation**
Previous sessions attempted too many integrations simultaneously, leading to incomplete features.

- Voice coaching with Hume AI integration
- Premium design system with brand compliance
- Auto-fix deployment system

### **Current Challenges**
- Need to implement core value proposition (Working Repo)
- Multiple AI integration opportunities requiring prioritization
- Balance between innovation and feature completion
- Ensure realistic session scope for complete implementations

### **Success Metrics**
- Feature completeness over partial implementations
- User value delivery over technology experimentation
- Working functionality over architectural complexity
- Clear progress over ambitious parallel development

## üöÄ **Recommended Restart Prompt**

```
Quest Core is a professional development platform with a 4-layer repository system (Surface/Working/Personal/Deep) that helps users discover their authentic professional identity through the Trinity system (Quest/Service/Pledge).

CURRENT STATUS:
‚úÖ Working: User auth (Clerk), database (PostgreSQL), voice coaching (Hume AI), 3D visualization, premium design system
üöß Next Priority: Choose ONE - Working Repo implementation (core value) OR Zep integration (AI memory foundation)

CONTEXT: Previous sessions attempted parallel implementation of multiple AI systems. This session should focus on completing ONE feature fully.

ARCHITECTURE: Hybrid data strategy with PostgreSQL as master, ready to integrate Zep (memory), OpenRouter (AI gateway), thesys.dev (adaptive UI).

DOCUMENTATION: Comprehensive - see CLAUDE.md for full context, NEXT_SESSION_TODO.md for sequential priorities.

GOAL: Deliver complete working feature rather than incomplete experiments.
