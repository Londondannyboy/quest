# Apify Integration Solutions

Due to issues with Next.js/Vercel not working with the Apify SDK (despite the EXACT same code working in apify-mp-mcp-server), we've created multiple solutions:

## 1. External Proxy Solution (WORKING)
The `/api/test-profile-simple` endpoint now uses your working apify-mp-mcp-server deployment as a proxy. This is a temporary solution but it works immediately.

## 2. Standalone Express Server
Created in `/apify-server/` - this is an exact copy of your working server that can be run separately:
```bash
cd apify-server
npm install
npm start
```
This runs on port 3001 and Quest Core can call it locally.

## 3. Vercel Serverless Function
Created in `/api/apify-scrape.js` - a standalone serverless function outside Next.js that might work better with Vercel.

## 4. Multiple Fallback Endpoint
`/api/linkedin-scrape` tries multiple methods in order:
1. External apify-mp-mcp-server
2. Local Express server
3. Direct Apify call

## Environment Variables
Add to Vercel:
```
APIFY_EXTERNAL_URL=https://apify-mp-mcp-server.vercel.app
```

## Why This Happened
Something about Next.js/Vercel's environment is preventing the Apify SDK from working properly, even though:
- The environment variables are set correctly
- The exact same code works in a simple Express app
- The token is valid

This is likely due to:
- Next.js edge runtime restrictions
- Vercel's serverless function environment
- Module loading differences

## Immediate Solution
The proxy solution is working now. For production, you can:
1. Keep using the external service
2. Deploy the Express server separately
3. Investigate Next.js compatibility further
