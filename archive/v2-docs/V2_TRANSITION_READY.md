## ðŸš€ **Recommended Prompt for Starting V2**

```
I want to create Quest Core V2, a revolutionary professional development platform. 

Key context:
- This is a fresh start in a new repository
- Philosophy: Users must "earn their Quest through story"
- Story â†’ Trinity â†’ Quest journey
- Reference docs are at: https://github.com/Londondannyboy/quest-core
- Main guide: V2_PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md
- Check V2_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md for environment variables

Please:
1. Create a new Next.js 15 project with TypeScript
2. Set up the foundational architecture following V2_PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md
3. Implement entity-first data models (no strings, only objects)
4. Start with Phase 1 from the requirements doc
5. Use the exact environment variable names from V2_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md

Let's begin with the core setup and entity system.
```

## ðŸ“‹ **Alternative Detailed Prompt**

```
I need to build Quest Core V2 based on comprehensive requirements at https://github.com/Londondannyboy/quest-core

Critical context:
- V2_PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md has all requirements
- V2_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md has env vars and common mistakes
- Entity-first architecture: every string must be an object
- Users earn Quest readiness (only 30% qualify)
- Multi-voice coaching with personality transitions

Start by:
1. Setting up Next.js 15 with Clerk auth
2. Creating entity models for Company, Skill, Education
3. Implementing LinkedIn scraping with Apify
4. Building the Professional Mirror visualization

Remember: "You can't begin your Quest until we understand your story"
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **What You'll Build First (Phase 1)**

Week 1-2 deliverables from V2_PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md:
1. Story â†’ Trinity â†’ Quest flow
2. Professional Mirror with LinkedIn + Harvest API  
3. Entity system with deduplication
4. Basic voice coaching
5. Temporal Trinity visualization
6. Semgrep security from Day 1

## ðŸ’¡ **Success Criteria**

You'll know V2 is working when:
- User provides LinkedIn URL
- System creates entities (not strings) for companies/skills
- Professional Mirror shows their journey
- Trinity emerges from their story
- Only qualified users reach Quest stage

**V1 Stats**: 42,600 lines of code, 20,000 lines of documentation
**V2 Goal**: Same functionality in 10% of the code

Ready to begin! ðŸš€
