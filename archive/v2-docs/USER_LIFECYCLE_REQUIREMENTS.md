# User Lifecycle Requirements - Complete Documentation

> **Purpose**: Prevent planning oversights by documenting every aspect of user management from sign-up to advanced features

## 📋 **Critical Learning: The User Creation Oversight**

### **What We Missed**
- **Assumption**: "Clerk handles users" = complete user management
- **Reality**: Clerk provides authentication, we must handle application user data
- **Impact**: Profile saving failed because users didn't exist in our database
- **Root Cause**: Feature-first planning without mapping fundamental user operations

### **Why This Happened**
1. **The Exciting Feature Trap**: Focused on 4-layer repos, AI coaching, Neo4j while ignoring basic CRUD
2. **Third-Party Service Assumption**: Treated Clerk as complete solution without boundary analysis
3. **Missing User Journey Documentation**: Had database schemas but no explicit user lifecycle flows
4. **Requirement vs Implementation Gap**: Documented features without operational requirements

## 🔄 **Complete User Lifecycle Flow**

### **Phase 1: Account Creation**
```
User Action: Signs up with email/password via Clerk
├── Clerk: Creates authentication record
├── Our System: MUST create database user record
├── Database: User row with Clerk ID mapping
└── Result: User can access authenticated routes
```

**Required Operations**:
- [ ] **C**reate: New user record in database with Clerk ID
- [ ] **R**ead: Verify user exists before profile operations
- [ ] **U**pdate: User metadata (name, email updates from Clerk)
- [ ] **D**elete: User account deletion with cascade rules

**API Endpoints Needed**:
- `POST /api/auth/create-user` ✅ (Implemented)
- `GET /api/auth/user-status` 
- `PUT /api/auth/update-user`
- `DELETE /api/auth/delete-user`

### **Phase 2: Profile Setup**
```
User Action: Creates professional profile
├── Surface Profile: Public LinkedIn-style data
├── Working Profile: Selective portfolio content
├── Personal Profile: Private goals and development
└── Deep Profile: AI-generated insights (system-managed)
```

**Required Operations for Each Profile Layer**:
- [ ] **Create**: Initial profile setup with default values
- [ ] **Read**: Load existing profile data for editing
- [ ] **Update**: Save profile changes with validation
- [ ] **Delete**: Profile deletion with data retention policies

### **Phase 3: Entity Management**
```
User Action: Adds work experience, skills, education
├── Companies: Search existing or create new
├── Skills: Search existing or create new  
├── Institutions: Search existing or create new
└── Relationships: Connect user to entities with metadata
```

**Required Operations for Each Entity Type**:
- [ ] **Search**: Fuzzy search existing entities
- [ ] **Create**: Add new entity if not found
- [ ] **Link**: Connect user to entity with relationship data
- [ ] **Unlink**: Remove user-entity relationship
- [ ] **Update**: Modify relationship metadata (dates, roles, etc.)

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
```
User Action: Uses AI coaching, visualization, networking
├── Voice Coaching: Requires complete profile context
├── 3D Visualization: Needs relationship data
├── Professional Network: Requires contact management
└── AI Insights: Depends on Deep Profile population
```

## 🏗️ **CRUD Operations Matrix**

### **Core User Management**
| Entity | Create | Read | Update | Delete | Search |
|--------|--------|------|--------|--------|--------|
| **User** | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ | N/A |
| **Authentication** | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ | N/A |

### **Profile Layers**
| Entity | Create | Read | Update | Delete | Search |
|--------|--------|------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Surface Profile** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | N/A |
| **Working Profile** | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ❌ | N/A |

## 🔐 **Authentication vs Authorization Boundaries**

### **What Clerk Handles**
- ✅ **Authentication**: User sign-up, sign-in, password reset
- ✅ **Session Management**: JWT tokens, session validation
- ✅ **Security**: Password policies, rate limiting, breach detection
- ✅ **OAuth Integration**: Google, GitHub, etc. sign-in options

### **What Our System Must Handle**
- ✅ **User Records**: Database entries with application-specific data
- ✅ **Authorization**: Route protection based on user roles/permissions
- ✅ **Profile Data**: All professional information and preferences
- ✅ **Relationships**: User connections to companies, skills, etc.
- ✅ **Business Logic**: Profile validation, data consistency, workflows

### **Integration Points**
```typescript
// Authentication Flow
1. User signs up via Clerk → Clerk creates auth record
2. Clerk webhook/API call → Our system creates database user
3. User accesses protected route → Middleware checks Clerk + our DB
4. Profile operations → Our system with Clerk user ID for authorization
```

## 📝 **Fundamental Requirements Checklist**

### **✅ Essential User Operations (Never Skip These)**
- [ ] **User Creation**: New users must have database records
- [ ] **User Reading**: All operations must verify user exists
- [ ] **User Updates**: Profile changes must update user data
- [ ] **User Deletion**: Account removal with proper cascade
- [ ] **Authentication Mapping**: Clerk ID to database user relationship
- [ ] **Session Validation**: Every API call validates user identity
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful failures for missing users
- [ ] **Data Consistency**: User data remains synchronized

### **🔧 Technical Implementation Requirements**
- [ ] **Database Schema**: User table with proper foreign keys
- [ ] **API Endpoints**: Complete CRUD operations for all entities
- [ ] **Middleware**: Authentication validation on protected routes
- [ ] **Error Messages**: Clear feedback for authentication failures
- [ ] **Data Migration**: User data import/export capabilities
- [ ] **Backup Strategy**: User data protection and recovery
- [ ] **Performance**: Efficient user lookup and caching
- [ ] **Monitoring**: User creation/authentication tracking

### **🎯 User Experience Requirements**
- [ ] **Onboarding Flow**: Guided setup for new users
- [ ] **Profile Completion**: Progress indicators and prompts
- [ ] **Data Persistence**: User work is never lost

## 🚨 **Common Planning Antipatterns (Avoid These)**

### **1. The Exciting Feature Trap**
- **Problem**: Focus on novel features while missing basic requirements
- **Example**: Building AI coaching before ensuring users can save profiles
- **Prevention**: Always document CRUD operations first

### **2. Third-Party Service Assumption**
- **Problem**: Assuming external services handle more than they do
- **Example**: "Clerk handles users" without mapping exact boundaries
- **Prevention**: Document what external services do AND don't handle

### **3. Data Model vs User Flow Gap**
- **Problem**: Having database schemas without user lifecycle mapping
- **Example**: User table exists but no user creation flow documented
- **Prevention**: Map complete user journeys alongside data models

### **4. Feature-First vs User-First Planning**
- **Problem**: Planning features without considering user operations
- **Example**: Neo4j graph visualization before basic profile CRUD
- **Prevention**: Start with user journey, then add features

## 📊 **User State Management**

### **User States in System**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    User Lifecycle States                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1. UNREGISTERED  → No account, can view public content     │
│ 2. AUTHENTICATED → Clerk account, no database record       │
│ 3. REGISTERED    → Database user exists, minimal profile   │
│ 4. ONBOARDING    → Completing profile setup process        │
│ 5. ACTIVE        → Complete profile, using all features    │
│ 6. INACTIVE      → Account exists but not recently used    │
│ 7. SUSPENDED     → Account temporarily disabled            │
│ 8. DELETED       → Account permanently removed             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **State Transition Requirements**
- [ ] **UNREGISTERED → AUTHENTICATED**: Clerk sign-up process
- [ ] **AUTHENTICATED → REGISTERED**: Database user creation
- [ ] **REGISTERED → ONBOARDING**: Profile setup initiation
- [ ] **ONBOARDING → ACTIVE**: Profile completion
- [ ] **ACTIVE → INACTIVE**: Inactivity timeout handling
- [ ] **ANY → SUSPENDED**: Admin or policy violations
- [ ] **ANY → DELETED**: User or admin account deletion

## 🔍 **Verification Questions for Any Feature**

### **Before Building Any Feature, Ask:**
1. **User Dependency**: Does this feature require a user to exist?
2. **CRUD Operations**: What create/read/update/delete operations are needed?
3. **Authentication**: How does user identity affect this feature?
4. **Authorization**: What permissions or access controls apply?
5. **Data Relationships**: How does this connect to existing user data?
6. **Error Scenarios**: What happens if user doesn't exist or lacks permission?
7. **State Management**: How does this feature affect user state?
8. **Third-Party Boundaries**: What external services are involved and what are their limits?

### **Documentation Requirements for Any Feature**
- [ ] **User Journey Flow**: Step-by-step user interaction
- [ ] **API Endpoints**: All required backend operations
- [ ] **Database Changes**: Schema updates and migrations
- [ ] **Authentication Requirements**: How user identity is verified
- [ ] **Error Handling**: All failure scenarios and user feedback
- [ ] **Testing Scenarios**: Both success and failure cases

## 🎯 **Implementation Priority for Missing Operations**

### **High Priority (Fix Immediately)**
- [ ] User update operations (name, email sync from Clerk)
- [ ] User deletion with proper cascade rules
- [ ] Profile layer completion (Working, Personal, Deep repos)
- [ ] Error handling for missing users

### **Medium Priority (Next Sprint)**
- [ ] User account recovery and data export
- [ ] Cross-device data synchronization
- [ ] User activity and analytics tracking
- [ ] Advanced privacy and permission controls

### **Low Priority (Future Enhancement)**
- [ ] User data migration tools
- [ ] Account suspension and restoration
- [ ] Advanced user segmentation
- [ ] Multi-tenant user management

---

**Key Insight**: User management is not a feature - it's the foundation that enables all features. Every planning document must explicitly address user lifecycle operations before any advanced functionality.

**Never Again**: No feature planning document should be considered complete without explicit user journey mapping and CRUD operation verification.
