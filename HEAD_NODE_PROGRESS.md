# Head Node Rendering Progress

## Session Summary (July 16, 2025)

### ðŸŽ¯ BREAKTHROUGH: Head Node Rendering Working!

**Key Discovery**: The head nodes were rendering correctly but viewed from behind + too dark to see clearly.

### âœ… Problems Solved

#### 1. **Visibility Issues**
- **Problem**: Head nodes appeared as basic shapes or were too dark
- **Root Cause**: Insufficient lighting + camera viewing from behind
- **Solution**: Enhanced lighting across all implementations
  - Ambient light: 0.6 â†’ 1.5 intensity
  - Directional light: 1.0 â†’ 2.0 intensity
  - Added front lighting: 1.5 intensity

#### 2. **Authentication Blocking**
- **Problem**: Main app required authentication to test head nodes
- **Solution**: Created `/test-head-visible` page without auth
- **Result**: Successfully demonstrates working head node rendering

### ðŸš€ Technical Achievements

#### **Head Geometry Creation Works**:
- Modified sphere geometry for realistic head shape
- Vertex manipulation for chin, back flattening, top narrowing
- Proper normal calculation and buffer updates

#### **Role-Based Styling Implemented**:
- **Executive**: Golden crown/halo effect
- **Developer**: Black glasses with bridge
- **Designer**: Colorful creative thought bubbles  
- **Manager**: Professional identification badge
- **Intern**: Graduation cap with tassel

#### **ForceGraph3D Integration**:
- `nodeThreeObject` prop working correctly
- `nodeThreeObjectExtend={true}` preserves custom geometry
- Proper lighting compatibility with React Force Graph

### ðŸ“‹ Next Session Goals

#### **Priority 1: Gender/Racial Neutral Styling**
- **Reference**: Three.js webgl_helpers examples
- **Style Goal**: Professional, inclusive, vector-based heads
- **Approach Options**:
  - Transparent geometric vectors
  - Isometric cube/cylinder combinations
  - Abstract professional representations

#### **Priority 2: Enhanced Role Differentiation**
- **Corporate Hierarchy**: CEO, CTO, VP, Director, Manager, Individual Contributor
- **Departments**: Engineering, Design, Product, Marketing, Sales, HR
- **Seniority Levels**: Intern, Junior, Mid, Senior, Principal, Executive
