# Session Summary: LinkedIn Scraping Integration

## Date: 2025-07-24

## What We Started With
- Failing LinkedIn scraping test at `/admin/test-scraping`
- 404 errors on registration pages
- Missing environment variables
- TypeScript errors blocking deployment

## What We Fixed
1. ✅ **Created missing registration pages** in correct directory
2. ✅ **Fixed TypeScript errors** in employees-scraper.ts
3. ✅ **Added public routes** to middleware
4. ✅ **Removed unnecessary email field** from admin interface
5. ✅ **Added company URL input** to registration flow
6. ✅ **Fixed all ESLint errors** for deployment
7. ✅ **Created enhanced registration endpoint** with company support

## LinkedIn Scraping Attempts
Despite multiple approaches, LinkedIn scraping remains broken:

### Working Configuration (from user)
- Task ID: `LpVuK3Zozwuipa5bp`
- User ID: `oagG2IEtw87XfSn3x`
- Actor: `harvestapi/linkedin-profile-scraper`
- Works perfectly in Apify console

### What We Tried
1. **Direct API** - Multiple endpoint formats, all failed
2. **MCP Integration** - Both complex and simple implementations
3. **Various endpoint structures** - With/without user ID
4. **Different authentication methods** - API key vs token

### The Core Problem
We cannot determine the correct API endpoint format for running a user-created task programmatically.

## Decision: Fresh Start Approach
User wisely suggested:
1. Create a minimal test project
2. Focus ONLY on Apify integration
3. Test in complete isolation
4. Once working, bring solution back to main project

## Current State
- Registration flow: ✅ Working
- Company URL integration: ✅ Implemented  
- LinkedIn scraping: ❌ Still failing
- Documentation: ✅ Comprehensive guides created

## Next Steps
1. New minimal project for Apify testing
2. Start with simplest possible implementation
3. Test both Direct API and MCP approaches
4. Document exact working solution
5. Port back to quest-core

## Key Learning
Sometimes stepping back and testing in isolation is the best debugging approach when integration attempts become too complex.
