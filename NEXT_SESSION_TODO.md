# Next Session TODO - July 16, 2025

> **Session Goal**: Neo4j Integration + Multi-Coach AI System Design

## ðŸŽ¯ **High Priority Tasks**

### 1. **Neo4j Graph Database Integration**
**Status**: Not started

- [ ] Build Cypher query layer for professional intelligence
- [ ] Update Force Graph to display Neo4j query results
- [ ] Test complex relationship queries

**Key Queries to Implement**:
- "Who worked with whom at which companies?"
- "What skills move between companies and roles?"
- "Career progression paths from role X to role Y"
- "Professional network community detection"

### 2. **Multi-Coach AI System Architecture Design**
**Status**: Research needed  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours

**Core Questions to Resolve**:
1. **Architecture Pattern**: Single LLM with personalities vs separate prompt systems?
2. **Orchestration**: How does master coach manage multiple AI voices?
3. **Debate Management**: Handling disagreements between coaches
4. **Authority Hierarchy**: Who has final say in coaching decisions?

**Implementation Options**:

**Option A - Single Engine Multi-Personality**:
```
Master Coach (Orchestrator)
â”œâ”€â”€ Career Coach (prompt: career strategy)
â”œâ”€â”€ Skills Coach (prompt: technical development) 
â”œâ”€â”€ Leadership Coach (prompt: management growth)
â””â”€â”€ Network Coach (prompt: relationship building)
```

**Option B - Separate AI Systems**:
```
Master Agent (Coordination)
â”œâ”€â”€ Separate LLM Instance 1 (Career)
â”œâ”€â”€ Separate LLM Instance 2 (Skills)
â”œâ”€â”€ Separate LLM Instance 3 (Leadership)
â””â”€â”€ Separate LLM Instance 4 (Network)
```

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Research multi-agent AI architecture patterns
- [ ] Design conversation flow and turn-taking protocol
- [ ] Create proof-of-concept with 2 coaches + orchestrator
- [ ] Test debate scenario handling
- [ ] Document coaching authority and decision-making hierarchy

### 3. **Planning Process Analysis & Documentation**
**Status**: Not started  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Time Estimate**: 1 hour

**Objective**: Understand why user creation was overlooked and prevent similar issues

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Analyze original planning documents for user management gaps
- [ ] Document assumption vs explicit requirement patterns
- [ ] Create "Fundamental Requirements Checklist" for future planning
- [ ] Review authentication flow documentation completeness
- [ ] Identify other potential planning blind spots

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Planning oversight analysis document
- [ ] Process improvement recommendations
- [ ] Updated planning templates with user flow requirements

## ðŸ”§ **Medium Priority Tasks**

### 4. **Enhanced Force Graph with Neo4j Results**
**Status**: Depends on Neo4j integration  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Time Estimate**: 2 hours

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Update ProfessionalNetworkGraph component to query Neo4j
- [ ] Add advanced filtering (by relationship type, strength, time period)
- [ ] Implement graph algorithm visualizations (shortest path, centrality)
- [ ] Add relationship strength heatmaps
- [ ] Create career path visualization mode

### 5. **Skills Progression Timeline**
**Status**: Design needed  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Time Estimate**: 2 hours

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Design skills timeline component (skills gained over time)
- [ ] Create API endpoint for skills progression data
- [ ] Add skill proficiency evolution visualization
- [ ] Integrate with work experience timeline for context

## ðŸ“‹ **Low Priority Tasks**

### 6. **Advanced Graph Intelligence Features**
**Status**: Future enhancement  
**Priority**: LOW  
**Time Estimate**: 4+ hours

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Career path recommendation engine
- [ ] Professional network influence scoring
- [ ] Skill market demand integration
- [ ] Industry trend analysis and visualization

### 7. **Performance & UX Enhancements**
**Status**: Future optimization  
**Priority**: LOW  
**Time Estimate**: 2 hours

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Large graph performance optimization
- [ ] Mobile-responsive 3D controls
- [ ] Progressive loading for complex networks
- [ ] Graph export functionality (PDF, PNG)

## ðŸ¤” **Research Questions**

### Multi-Coach AI System Design
1. **Conversation Flow**: How to prevent coaches from talking over each other?
2. **Context Sharing**: Do all coaches share the same user context or have specialized views?
3. **Disagreement Resolution**: What happens when coaches give conflicting advice?
4. **User Experience**: How does user interact with multiple coaches simultaneously?
5. **Coaching Effectiveness**: Single focused coach vs collaborative coaching team?

### Neo4j Integration Architecture  
1. **Data Sync Strategy**: Real-time sync vs batch updates from PostgreSQL?
2. **Query Performance**: Client-side Cypher vs API layer abstraction?
3. **Relationship Modeling**: How to represent professional relationship strength and context?
4. **Scalability**: Multi-tenant Neo4j design for multiple users?
