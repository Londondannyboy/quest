## ðŸŽ¯ **RECOMMENDED SESSION FOCUS**

### **Primary Recommendation: Working Repo Implementation**
**Why**: Core value proposition that differentiates Quest from LinkedIn and other platforms
**Impact**: Immediate user value and business differentiation
**Complexity**: Manageable scope for single session
**Dependencies**: Minimal - uses existing authentication and database

### **Alternative: Complete Zep Integration**
**Why**: Foundation for all future AI enhancements
**Impact**: Enables persistent memory across all coaching interactions
**Complexity**: Moderate - requires careful integration testing
**Dependencies**: Minimal - integrates with existing voice coaching

### **Not Recommended This Session**:
- Multi-system parallel implementations
- Experimental technology evaluation (PocketFlow, thesys.dev) without core features
- Complex integrations requiring multiple prerequisites

**Success Criteria**: ONE fully working feature rather than multiple incomplete experiments

**Next Session Strategy**: Build on completed foundation with next logical integration
